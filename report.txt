Three observations from the data:

1. The three types of cities seem to cluster very nicely together. There is almost a distinctness between where one begins and the other ends (Fig.2016PyberRideSharingData.png).

2. The fares are higher in rural areas with less drivers, and urban areas having more drives and lower fares. 

3. Urban drivers, incoming and rides as indecated by all three pie charts makes up more than 60% of total observations plotted.
